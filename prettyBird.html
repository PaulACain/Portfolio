          <h4 class="summary-header">Overview</h4>
          <p>Pretty Bird Coffee is a family owned specialty cafe and roastery that services the local community in Yardley Pa. The cafe offers high quality espresso beverages and made to order breakfast and lunch sandwiches. I was apart of the inital team that opened the cafe in 2017. One problem became increasingly clear during my time there.The business was suffering from excessively long order times. My solution was to create an advanced ordering app to help alleviate pressure during peak hours.</p>
          <h4 class="summary-header">The Problem</h4>
          <p>Right now, you could walk into Pretty Bird and wait up to 10 minutes for your latte, or 15 minutes for your breakfast sandwich.The coffee business lives and dies by the morning commuter business. Situated right off 95, and a short drive from the NJ transit, Yardley is hub for city commuters. However, due to Pretty Bird's varying order times, customers weren't confident that can consistently get their coffee before heading off to work.</p>
          <h4 class="summary-header">The Solution</h4>
          <p>My solution is to create an advanced ordering application that would reduce customers wait time in store, and expand Pretty Bird’s customer base by recapturing the commuter market. In order to accomplish I conducted user research, preformed key user flows, tested wireframes, and developed high fidelity mockups for a mobile app. </p>

        <h6>Learning from the best</h6>
        <p class="width-adjustment"> Situated directly across the street from Pretty Bird sits a Starbucks. In what feels like a David versus Goliath story, my object was to analyze the coffee giants app and look for key differentiating factors. To kick off my research I broke down the features and processes that make the Starbucks app so successful.<br><br>- Create an experience: Starbuck’s app is intended to feel like their store. Users can purchase virtually everything available in store including coffee beans and gift cards. Users can also see featured items, and pay with ease just as they can in store.<br><br>- Creating pattern: The app uses design patterns to create a user friendly design. Through typography,  UI cards, processes and call to action buttons, users know what to expect when using the app.<br><br>- Intuitive layout: The app’s informational hierarchy uses big dashboards, contrasting color scheme, and leverages effective spacing to create clear guidance for users to navigate through the app.<br><br>- User centered wayfinding: The app uses a combination of headers, top and bottom navigation to help guide users to where they’re going and show them where they’ve been.</p>

We must validate our assumptions.<br><br>In order to test my assumption that the local community of Yardley and the Pretty Bird loyalist alike want an advanced mobile ordering application, I conducted a user survey.<br><br>I created a 10 questions survey with 2 goals in mind:<br><br>1.

The purpose of this was to help me focus on the users experience and see what necessary steps would be required in order to complete the most important tasks.<br><br>I was able to see what worked well, and what needed to be addressed in the next stage of development. One of the biggest takeaways I took from this exercise is the importance of navigation assistance through clear call to actions. Pretty Bird’s menu is fairly large and nearly everything can be changed. Ensuring the application wasn’t overly complicated became my biggest challenge moving forward.</p>

                  <p class="width-adjustment">Once I believed I had created a wire frame that satisfied all the important user flows, I took my newly create high fidelity prototype to the streets. I conducted a handful of user tests asking each of my participants to complete three tasks:<br><br>1. Customize a latte then complete your order (Going through whatever on-boarding process they seemed fit)<br><br>2. From the dashboard view your points and determine what goals you’re eligible to claim<br><br>3. From the dashboard determine if the store was open <br><br>After closely monitoring my participants as they completed each task, I sat down and spoke to them about their experience. The results were a mixed. On one hand, my participants had no problems navigating through the ordering process. Which I took as a huge success. However, I found that in my dedication to solving one complex problem, I forgot to consider basic functions. Such as the delaying on-boarding to allow users to fall in love with the app before making a commitment. I also learned that my wireframe was too dense with content. I found that in my effort to create an extremely easy to use app, I wasn’t considering what my users wanted to do at any given point. With that, I built a plan to tackle my high fidelity mockups.</p>

In order to avoid laborious sign up process, I also boiled down the necessary information needed into two separate screens to make it easier for the users to digest. And just to be safe, I also included an option to bypass on-boarding all together so users can explore and browse without having to make a commitment.</p>

                  <p class="width-adjustment key-insight"> Key insight: Our brand colors are off black and Carolina blue. We wanted our primary color to match our ceramic ware in store. If you were to walk into PrettyBird right now you would see splashes of blue across the cafe creating a colorful, joyful environment. I chose to use a variety of shades of the Carolina blue throughout the app and promote trustworthiness as well as affirm users that they’re getting the same quality service. In addition to our Carolina blue, I chose to use a soft yellow as my warning color and a sea foam green as my accent color to draw clear contrast to sections throughout the app.</p>

            <p class="width-adjustment">I went into this project with confidence. I have 8+ years of coffee industry experience. I’ve worked across all levels of the business, and played a major role in the opening of two cafes. I believed with conviction that I had the understanding necessary to create a successful advanced ordering application. I found out rather quickly that my experience could only carry me so far. If I could boil down what I learned through this process i’d be these two rules:<br><br>- Assume nothing, prove everything<br>- Follow your process. <br><br>Early on in the project I made few assumption without testing them. I had to find out the hard way that no matter what I’m working on, I need to approach the problem as if it’s the first time i’m confronting it. Or in other words, I need to always go back to the basics.<br><br>I also believe that I rushed part of my process. In particular,  I think I rushed into designing my wireframes. Reflecting back on it now, I wish I spent more time in the sketching phase. I believed I thought my experience would carry me through any road bumps. However, I ended up spending too much time iterating features and sections that should’ve already been established. It was a long journey, but I think a very important one for me. </p>
