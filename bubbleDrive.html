Is there is a market for a cloud storage tool in the small businesses space<br><br> After gathering 17 responses from individuals across the world from with a diverse background, I was able to determine the following from the surveys:<br><br>1. Users were extremely familiar with cloud storage applications with approximately nearly 50% using a product for work<br>2. The most important features for applications are ability to upload content, the ability to share and the ability to create content all within the application.<br>3. Of my 17 participants, 76% have worked in some capacity in a small business. Of those, 84% said that a cloud storage tool that allows owners/managers to share and collaborate with staff would be beneficial</p>

Resize pages to avoid call to actions that require scroll down navigation to locate.<br>2. More obvious call to action buttons relating to their purposes. For example the a return to dashboard button<br>3. More obvious organizational prompts for files and folders.</p>
