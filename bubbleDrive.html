        <h4> Competitive analysis</h4>
        <p> In order to understand where an opportunity might lie in the cloud storage space, I examined the major players in the landscape. What I became acutely aware of is how the market demands niche storage locations catering to a unique types of user. These specialized digital storage spaces are curated to specific people, industries, and even products. <br><br> With that in mind, I suggested to the client to leverage their position and create an application that caters to entrepreneurs and small businesses.

      <h4>User research</h4>
      <p> In order to learn more about potential users for this application, I created a user research survey. In this process I was attempting to learn following:</p>


      <li>How familiar are people with cloud storage applications</li>
      <li>What application features are most important to users</li>
      <li>Is there is a market for a cloud storage tool in the small businesses space</li>

      <p>After gathering 17 responses from individuals across the world from with a diverse background, I was able to determine the following from the surveys: </p>

      <li>Users were extremely familiar with cloud storage applications with approximately nearly 50% using a product for work</li>
      <li>The most important features for applications are ability to upload content, the ability to share and the ability to create content all within the application.</li>
      <li>Of my 17 participants, 76% have worked in some capacity in a small business. Of those, 84% said that a cloud storage tool that allows owners/managers to share and collaborate with staff would be beneficial </li>
