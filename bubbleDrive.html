      <h4>User research</h4>
      <p class="width-adjustment"> In order to learn more about potential users for this application, I created a user research survey. In this process I was attempting to learn following:<br><br>1. How familiar are people with cloud storage applications<br><br>2. What application features are most important to users<br><br>3. Is there is a market for a cloud storage tool in the small businesses space<br><br> After gathering 17 responses from individuals across the world from with a diverse background, I was able to determine the following from the surveys:<br><br>1. Users were extremely familiar with cloud storage applications with approximately nearly 50% using a product for work<br><br>2. The most important features for applications are ability to upload content, the ability to share and the ability to create content all within the application.<br><br>3. Of my 17 participants, 76% have worked in some capacity in a small business. Of those, 84% said that a cloud storage tool that allows owners/managers to share and collaborate with staff would be beneficial</p>

          <p class="width-adjustment"> Key insight: I landed on a piece of gum for my logo design. My inspiration was derived from the Hubba Bubba bubble gum popular in the late 90’s. I was hoping to achieve  a nostalgic yet fresh feel with the design. However, my clients didn’t feel the same way - which lead me back to the drawing board.</p>

      <p class="width-adjustment">I realized I didn’t have a full understanding of the client’s brand expectation. I presented them with the logo using a piece of bubble gum as my inspiration. They did not like it. Though they were very happy with the idea and the name, they wanted more from the logo. The feedback they gave me listed out a couple of requirements for my next submission.<br><br>1. The logo needs to incorporate a bubble in some way<br><br>2. The logo needs to work as a stand alone icon <br><br>3. The logo should feel more professional</p>
