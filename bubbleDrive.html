        <p class="width-adjustment"> In order to understand where an opportunity might lie in the cloud storage space, I examined the major players in the landscape. What I became acutely aware of is how the market demands niche storage locations that cater to unique types of user. These specialized digital storage spaces are curated to specific people, industries, and even products. <br><br> With that in mind, I suggested to the client to leverage their position and create an application that caters to entrepreneurs and small businesses.

          <p class="width-adjustment"> In order to learn more about potential users for this application, I created a user research survey. In this process I was attempting to learn following:<br><br>1. How familiar are people with cloud storage applications<br>2. What application features are most important to users<br>3. Is there is a market for a cloud storage tool in the small business landscape<br><br> After gathering 17 responses from individuals across the world with a diverse background, I was able to determine the following from the surveys:<br><br>1. Users were extremely familiar with cloud storage applications with approximately 50% using a product for work related reasons.<br>2. The most important features for applications are ability to upload content, share and create content all within the application.<br>3. Of my 17 participants, 76% have worked in some capacity in a small business. Of those, 84% said that a cloud storage tool that allows owners/managers to share and collaborate with staff would be beneficial</p>

The feedback they gave me listed out a couple of requirements for my next submission.<br><br>1. The logo needs to incorporate a bubble in some way.<br>2. The logo needs to work as a stand alone icon. <br>3. The logo should feel more professional.</p>

Testing wireframes also provided me with useful site navigation data as I could watch users attempt to solve the tasks asked of them. Using InVison to create a clickable prototype, I followed a written script to conduct four surveys. Test feedback informed me of top actions the application required:<br><br>1. Resize pages to avoid call to actions that require scroll down navigation to locate.<br>2. More obvious call to action buttons relating to their purposes. For example: the return to dashboard button<br>3. More obvious organizational prompts for files and folders.</p>

Using the same formula from the first user testing I was able to observe, monitor and capture insights from my participants. The key changes I needed to improve were:<br><br>1. Multiple interaction points for users to engage with their folders and files.<br> 2. Clean and concise dashboard with resizing sections, headers and buttons.<br>3.

If time allowed, I would have created additional team pages and worked towards an in-app messaging system.<br><br>My time with this project has taught me the importance of a thorough design process.
